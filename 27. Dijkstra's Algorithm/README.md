# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is a very famous algorithm, if not the most famous algorithm out there. This algorithm uses a priority queue as part of its implementation. For this section, I will use the priority queue used in section 23, binary heaps.

This algorithm is used to calculte shortest paths between vertices in a graph and it has many, many uses. But, for this algorithm to work, the graphs **must** be weighted.

## Who was Dijkstra and what is his Algorithm

It's used all the time. Often, big tech companies will base a lof of their proprietary algorithms on top of Djikstra's Algorithm.

This algorithm finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph. If we had a graph of 10000 vertices, what's the shortest way from point A to point B?

Edsger Djikstra was a Dutch programmer, physicist, essayist, he wrote tons of academic papers on programming, mathematics, problem solving, and very influential. He helped advance the field of computer science from a burgeoning art to the righ academic discipline that it is today. He established a lot of the academic rigor that's present in today's computer science, he came up with many papers, most of which are still cited today.

He also created new fields in whitin computer science based on single papers that he wrote, and unlike some other pioneers whose works at the time were very important and led the way for other breakthroughs, then sort of became less relevant in today's world, a lot of Djikstra's works are still in practice today and commonly used, like Dijkstra's Algorithm. He really is known for a lot of things, not just this algorithm.

In today's world this algorithm is still useful for things such as:

- **GPS**: Finding fastest routes.
- **Network Routing**: Finds open shortest path for data.
- **Biology**: Used to model the spread of viruses among humans.
- **Airline Tickets**: Finding the cheapest route to your destination.
- The list goes on.

But as mentioned earlier, big companies add enhancements on top of this algorithm such as Google Maps algorithm not only considering distances but also considering the capacity of roads, turns, traffic, accidents, weather, holidays, time of day, etc. And while it is a lof of enhancements, it all boils down to finding the shortest path.
