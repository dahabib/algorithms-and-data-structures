# Trees

## What is a Tree

A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship. We basically end up with branches where each node can end up with one or multiple or zero nodes, and each node can keep splitting, so multiple branches can be created.

## Contrast between Trees and Lists

Lists are **linear**. Everything is in a line, in one row. We have a list item, then the next list item, then so on.

In trees, we can expect everything to be **nonlinear**. There are many paths you can take while traversing trees.

**Bear in mind**, that siblings can't point to other children in trees. Children pointing to other children while at the same time following parent/child relationship data structures are known as **graphs**. In a tree, every node is moving away from the root node. Trees also only have **one** entry point.

## Tree Terminology

- **Root**: The top node of a tree.
- **Child**: A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.
- **Parent**: Converse node of a child.
- **Siblings**: A group of nodes with the same parent.
- **Leaf**: A node with no children.
- **Edge**: The connection between one node and another.
