# Data Strutures

From here on out, everything will be related to new data structures. There are tons of data structures, all of them excelling at certain things, some of them being for more general porpuses while some of them being really good at niche porpuses.

Some of the most popular data structures are:

- Binary Search Trees.
- Queues.
- Singly Linked Lists.
- Undirected Unweighted Graphs.
- Binary Heaps.
- Directed Graphs.
- Hash Tables.
- Doubly Linked Lists.
- Stacks.
- Much others.

## What makes a Data Structure

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures. Chances are you've already worked with an API or a library that returns a Graph or similar. You've already worked with many of them unknowingly.

As previously said, they all excel at different environments. For example:

- Working with map/location data? Trying to write code that will route you to the nearest gas station? Or are you writing pathfinding API for a Video Game AI? You might want to use a graph.
- Need an ordered list like an array with fast inserts/removals not just at the beginning but at the end also? Use a linked lists.
- Web scraping nested HTML for the latest news? Use a tree.
- Need to write a scheduler? Use a binary heap to quickly find the highest priority task at any given point.
