# Advante Sorts

- Understand the limitations of the sorting algorithms we've learned so far.
- Implement merge sort.
- Implement quick sort.
- Implement radix sort.

## The Why

The basic sorting algorithms don't scale well if they're working on an array of 100000+ items. There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from `O(n^2)` to `O(n * log n)`.

There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity. The more efficient algorithms are much less simple and take more effort to understand.
